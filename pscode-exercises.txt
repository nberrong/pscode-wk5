// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

   Sum=Num1 + Num2

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

    IF %2 = 0
       PRINT "Even"
    ELSE
       PRINT "Odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

ENTER number1, number2, number3, number4, number5
SUM = number1 + number2 + number3 + number4 + number5
AVERAGE = SUM / 5

SET MAX = number1
SET MIN = number1

IF number2 > MAX
  {
    THEN MAX = number2
    ELSE IF number2 < MIN THEN MIN = number2
  }
IF number3 > MAX
  {
    THEN MAX = number3
    ELSE IF number3 < MIN THEN MIN = number3
  }
IF number4 > MAX
  {
    THEN MAX = number4
    ELSE IF number4 < MIN THEN MIN = number4
  }
IF number5 > MAX
  {
    THEN MAX = number5
    ELSE IF number5 < MIN THEN MIN = number5
  }

PRINT ("Average of all five numbers: ", AVERAGE)
PRINT ("Smallest of all five numbers: ", MIN)
PRINT ("Largest of all five numbers: ", MAX)
